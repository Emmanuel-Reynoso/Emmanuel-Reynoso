Hello! I welcome you to my profile ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“« I'm Emmanuel, I studied at FaMAF the career of Computer Science (2nd year) and currently Tecnicatura Superior in Data Science and AI in ISPC about to finish in this 2023. 

 ðŸŒ± Before entering the careers or courses I did, I was already fascinated by analyzing, looking for the advantages and disadvantages of making decisions. It seems to me that there are many situations where, if we look a bit more analytically, we find great opportunities.

ðŸŽ¯ My next goal is to develop as a professional in Data Science in a team where I can apply my knowledge and with the possibility of continuing to grow as a professional.
